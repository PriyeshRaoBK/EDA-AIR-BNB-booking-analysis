# AIR BNB BOOKIN ANALYSIS

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.
This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.

# What is AIRBNB?
Airbnb, Inc., based in San Francisco, California, operates an online marketplace focused on short-term homestays and experiences. The company acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia.

## Summary
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Airbnb booking analysis is a critical component of the overall project aimed at understanding the various factors that influence customer booking decisions on the Airbnb platform. The EDA will provide insights into the patterns and trends in the booking data and identify any underlying relationships between variables that may impact customer behavior.

The EDA will begin with data collection from the Airbnb platform, including information on the listings, their availability, prices, and customer reviews. The data will then be cleaned to remove any missing, inconsistent, or irrelevant information. The next phase of the EDA will involve data analysis to uncover patterns and trends in customer behavior, such as the most popular listing types, the most sought-after amenities, and the factors that impact booking rates.

Data visualization will be used to effectively communicate the insights and findings of the data analysis. A combination of graphs, charts, and maps will be used to showcase the trends and patterns in the data. This will help to identify areas of opportunity and highlight areas that require improvement.

The final phase of the EDA will involve summarizing the findings and providing recommendations on how the insights can be leveraged to improve the customer experience and increase booking rates. This will include recommendations on optimizing pricing strategies, enhancing the listing descriptions, and improving the overall customer experience. The findings and recommendations will be presented in a comprehensive report, detailing the methodology, findings, and recommendations.

In conclusion, the EDA of Airbnb booking analysis will provide valuable insights into the patterns and relationships in the booking data and inform the development of predictive models that can be used to optimize the platform. The EDA will play a crucial role in ensuring the success of the overall Airbnb booking analysis project by providing a foundation for further analysis and optimization. The insights and recommendations generated by the EDA will help to drive growth and success for the Airbnb platform and ensure its continued evolution and adaptation to changing customer needs and preferences.
