        "The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Airbnb booking analysis is a critical component of the overall project aimed at understanding the various factors that influence customer booking decisions on the Airbnb platform. The EDA will provide insights into the patterns and trends in the booking data and identify any underlying relationships between variables that may impact customer behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The EDA will begin with data collection from the Airbnb platform, including information on the listings, their availability, prices, and customer reviews. The data will then be cleaned to remove any missing, inconsistent, or irrelevant information. The next phase of the EDA will involve data analysis to uncover patterns and trends in customer behavior, such as the most popular listing types, the most sought-after amenities, and the factors that impact booking rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data visualization will be used to effectively communicate the insights and findings of the data analysis. A combination of graphs, charts, and maps will be used to showcase the trends and patterns in the data. This will help to identify areas of opportunity and highlight areas that require improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final phase of the EDA will involve summarizing the findings and providing recommendations on how the insights can be leveraged to improve the customer experience and increase booking rates. This will include recommendations on optimizing pricing strategies, enhancing the listing descriptions, and improving the overall customer experience. The findings and recommendations will be presented in a comprehensive report, detailing the methodology, findings, and recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the EDA of Airbnb booking analysis will provide valuable insights into the patterns and relationships in the booking data and inform the development of predictive models that can be used to optimize the platform. The EDA will play a crucial role in ensuring the success of the overall Airbnb booking analysis project by providing a foundation for further analysis and optimization. The insights and recommendations generated by the EDA will help to drive growth and success for the Airbnb platform and ensure its continued evolution and adaptation to changing customer needs and preferences."

There are many outliers in manhattan so the costliest property is in manhattan followed by Brooklyn. This information can also be seen in the violin plot. From the scatter plot, you can see that there are properties that cost 10000 dollars in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Most of the costliest property is available in these two areas. This observation is shown in longitude- latitude plot. Prices above 400 dollars are shown in red and less than 150 dollars are shown in blue.
